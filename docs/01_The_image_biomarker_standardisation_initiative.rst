The image biomarker standardisation initiative
==============================================

The image biomarker standardisation initiative (IBSI) is an independent
international collaboration which works towards standardising the
extraction of image biomarkers from acquired imaging for the purpose of
high-throughput quantitative image analysis (radiomics). Lack of
reproducibility and validation of high-throughput quantitative image
analysis studies is considered to be a major challenge for the
field :cite:`Gillies2015,Yip2016,Hatt2016`. Part of this
challenge lies in the scantiness of consensus-based guidelines and
definitions for the process of translating acquired imaging into
high-throughput image biomarkers. The IBSI therefore seeks to provide
image biomarker nomenclature and definitions, benchmark data sets, and
benchmark values to verify image processing and image biomarker
calculations, as well as reporting guidelines, for high-throughput image
analysis.

Permanent identifiers
---------------------

The IBSI uses permanent identifiers for image biomarker definitions and
important related concepts such as image processing. These consist of
four-character codes and may be used for reference. Please do not use
page numbers or section numbers as references, as these are subject to
change.
